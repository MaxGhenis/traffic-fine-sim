# Introduction

The design of traffic fine systems represents a critical intersection of public safety policy, distributional concerns, and economic efficiency. While most jurisdictions employ flat-rate fines that impose the same monetary penalty regardless of the violator's income, several countries—notably Finland, Switzerland, and parts of Germany—have implemented income-based fine systems where penalties scale with the offender's earnings. This divergence in approaches raises fundamental questions about the optimal structure of deterrent penalties and their broader economic implications.

The traditional economic argument for income-based fines rests on the principle of equal marginal deterrence. Since the marginal utility of income decreases with wealth, a fixed fine of $200 represents a substantially different burden for someone earning $20,000 versus $200,000 annually. Proponents argue that income-based fines restore horizontal equity by ensuring that the utility cost of violations is comparable across the income distribution, thereby achieving more uniform deterrence effects.

However, this seemingly straightforward argument overlooks a crucial economic mechanism: income-based fines function as implicit marginal tax rates on labor income for those who choose to speed. When a traffic fine is calculated as a percentage of income, it effectively increases the marginal tax rate faced by violators, creating disincentives to work that are absent under flat fine regimes. This paper demonstrates that these labor supply distortions can be substantial enough to offset or reverse the welfare gains from improved deterrence equity.

## The Double Distortion Problem

The core insight of our analysis is that income-based fines create what we term a "double distortion" in individual behavior. The first distortion is intentional: fines are meant to deter speeding by making it costly. The second distortion is an unintended consequence: by linking fines to income, the policy inadvertently taxes productive labor activity. This second distortion is particularly problematic because it compounds existing tax distortions in the labor market, potentially generating significant deadweight losses.

Consider a high-income individual facing a 40% marginal tax rate who regularly speeds. Under an income-based fine system where speeding violations add an expected 5% to the effective tax rate, this person now faces a 45% marginal rate on additional earnings. Standard optimal tax theory suggests that the deadweight loss from taxation increases with the square of the tax rate, implying that adding 5 percentage points to an already-high rate generates disproportionately large efficiency costs.

## Contribution to the Literature

This paper makes several contributions to both the traffic safety and public economics literatures. First, we develop a tractable model that captures the joint determination of labor supply and speeding decisions, allowing us to quantify the efficiency costs of income-based fines. Second, we demonstrate that the welfare ranking of flat versus income-based fines depends critically on the elasticity of labor supply and the existing tax rate—parameters that vary across countries and populations. Third, we show that redistribution of fine revenues through universal transfers can partially offset but not eliminate the efficiency disadvantages of income-based systems.

Our analysis also connects to broader debates about the use of income-contingent penalties in other domains, such as criminal justice, regulatory enforcement, and civil litigation. The labor supply channel we identify applies whenever penalties are linked to economic productivity, suggesting that our results have implications beyond traffic policy.

## Policy Relevance

The question of optimal fine structure has gained renewed attention as governments seek both to improve road safety and address growing concerns about inequality. Several U.S. cities have recently considered adopting income-based traffic fines, often citing the Finnish model as inspiration. Our results suggest that such reforms, while well-intentioned, may reduce overall welfare if implemented without careful consideration of their labor market effects.

Moreover, technological advances in enforcement—such as automated speed cameras and real-time income verification systems—have made income-based fines more feasible to implement. As these administrative barriers fall, understanding the economic trade-offs becomes increasingly important for policy design.

## Paper Overview

The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant literature on traffic fines, optimal taxation, and behavioral responses to penalties. Section 3 presents our theoretical model, deriving the key mechanisms through which income-based fines affect welfare. Section 4 describes our simulation methodology and parameter calibration. Section 5 presents our main results, including sensitivity analyses and robustness checks. Section 6 discusses policy implications and extensions. Section 7 concludes.

Throughout, we maintain focus on the central tension between equity and efficiency that characterizes many public policy debates. While income-based fines may appear more equitable in isolation, their interaction with the tax system creates efficiency costs that must be weighed against distributional benefits. Our analysis provides a framework for making these trade-offs explicit and quantifiable.
