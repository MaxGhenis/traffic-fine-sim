## Recommended Target: Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization

Given our paper's focus on behavioral responses to policy and welfare analysis, JEBO represents the best fit. The journal has published similar work on optimal penalty design and behavioral public finance.

Dear Editor,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript "Income-Based Traffic Fines as Implicit Marginal Tax Rates: A Welfare Analysis" for consideration for publication in the Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization.

This paper examines a timely policy question—whether traffic fines should be linked to income—through the lens of optimal taxation theory. While several countries have implemented income-based fine systems on fairness grounds, we demonstrate that such policies create implicit marginal tax rates that distort labor supply decisions. Our agent-based simulation model reveals that these distortions can be substantial enough to offset the equity benefits of income-based fines.

The paper makes three main contributions:

1. We identify a previously unrecognized mechanism through which income-based penalties affect welfare—the implicit taxation of productive activity.

2. We develop a tractable computational framework that captures joint optimization of labor supply and violation decisions, applicable to various penalty design problems.

3. We provide policy-relevant insights showing that the welfare ranking of fine systems depends critically on labor supply elasticity and existing tax rates.

Our findings have immediate policy relevance as several U.S. jurisdictions consider adopting income-based fine systems. The paper also contributes to the broader literature on optimal taxation and behavioral responses to government policy.

The manuscript has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration at any other journal. All authors have approved the submission.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
