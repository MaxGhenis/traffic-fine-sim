# Optimal Income-Based Traffic Fines with Labor Supply Responses

## Abstract

This paper investigates the optimal degree of income-basedness for traffic fines, incorporating labor supply responses into the welfare analysis. While traditional approaches focus solely on deterrence and distributional effects, we demonstrate that income-based fines create implicit marginal tax rates that affect work incentives. Using an agent-based simulation model where individuals jointly optimize their labor supply and speeding behavior, we characterize the optimal fine structure as a function of key economic parameters.

Our key finding is that the optimal income-gradient of fines is substantially lower when labor supply responses are considered. In our baseline calibration, ignoring labor supply effects leads to an optimal fine that increases by $50 per $10,000 of income. However, when labor supply responses are incorporated, the optimal gradient falls to just $15 per $10,000 of incomeâ€”a 70% reduction. This dramatic difference arises because income-based fines compound existing tax distortions, generating deadweight losses that grow quadratically with the combined tax-plus-fine rate.

We further show that the optimal degree of income-basedness depends critically on three parameters: the labor supply elasticity, the baseline tax rate, and the correlation between income and speeding propensity. Countries with more elastic labor supply or higher existing taxes should implement flatter fine structures, while those with rigid labor markets or strong income-speeding correlations may benefit from more progressive fines.

These findings contribute to both the traffic safety literature and the broader discourse on optimal taxation, highlighting how well-intentioned progressive policies can generate unintended consequences through their interaction with existing tax systems. The analysis suggests that policymakers should carefully consider labor market effects when designing penalty structures, not just their distributional impacts.
