# Income-Based Traffic Fines as Implicit Marginal Tax Rates: A Welfare Analysis

## Abstract

This paper examines the welfare implications of income-based traffic fines through the lens of optimal taxation theory. While income-based fines are often advocated on fairness grounds—ensuring equal deterrence across income levels—we demonstrate that they function as implicit marginal tax rates that distort labor supply decisions. Using an agent-based simulation model where individuals jointly optimize their labor supply and speeding behavior, we find that the labor market distortions introduced by income-based fines can offset or even reverse their perceived fairness benefits.

Our model incorporates several key features: heterogeneous agents with varying income potentials, endogenous death probabilities based on aggregate speeding behavior, and redistribution of collected fines and taxes through universal basic income. We compare social welfare under optimally-calibrated flat and income-based fine systems, accounting for both deterrence effects and labor supply responses.

The results reveal a fundamental trade-off between horizontal equity (equal burden relative to income) and economic efficiency. Income-based fines create a "double distortion" problem: they not only affect speeding decisions but also reduce labor supply among higher earners who face elevated effective marginal tax rates. For reasonable parameter values, we find that flat fines often dominate income-based fines from a total welfare perspective, particularly when the elasticity of labor supply is substantial.

These findings contribute to both the traffic safety literature and the broader discourse on optimal taxation, highlighting how well-intentioned progressive policies can generate unintended consequences through their interaction with existing tax systems. The analysis suggests that policymakers should carefully consider labor market effects when designing penalty structures, not just their distributional impacts.
