# Literature Review

The analysis of income-based traffic fines sits at the intersection of several economic literatures: optimal taxation, law and economics, behavioral public finance, and transportation safety. This section reviews the key contributions in each area and positions our work within this broader context.

## Optimal Taxation and Behavioral Responses

The modern theory of optimal taxation, pioneered by {cite}`mirrlees1971` and refined by Diamond and Mirrlees (1971), provides the theoretical foundation for understanding how income-linked policies affect welfare. Saez (2001) demonstrated that behavioral responses to taxation can be summarized through the elasticity of taxable income (ETI), a sufficient statistic for welfare analysis under certain conditions.

{cite}`feldstein1999` emphasized that the ETI captures all behavioral margins—labor supply, tax avoidance, and evasion—making it particularly relevant for our context where individuals can respond to income-based fines through multiple channels. Recent estimates suggest ETI values ranging from 0.12 to 0.40 for most populations {citep}`saez2012`, with higher values for top earners who have greater flexibility in their labor supply decisions.

The concept of effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs) has been extensively studied in the context of transfer programs. Maag et al. (2012) show how benefit phase-outs create implicit taxes that can exceed 100% for low-income families. Our contribution extends this literature by demonstrating that regulatory penalties can similarly function as implicit taxes, with income-based traffic fines representing a previously unexamined source of EMTR variation.

## Economics of Traffic Enforcement

The economic analysis of traffic enforcement began with {cite}`becker1968`'s seminal work on the economics of crime, which established the framework of optimal deterrence through expected penalties. Polinsky and Shavell (1979) refined this approach, showing that optimal fines should generally equal the harm caused by violations when enforcement is costly.

Specific to traffic violations, several papers have examined the deterrent effects of fines and enforcement intensity. Bourgeon and Picard (2007) develop a model where drivers choose both whether to violate traffic rules and how much care to exercise, finding that fine structures affect both margins. DeAngelo and Hansen (2014) use a natural experiment from Oregon to show that traffic fatalities increase when police enforcement decreases, confirming the importance of deterrence.

The empirical literature on income-based fines is limited but growing. Makowsky and Stratmann (2009) find evidence that municipalities with greater fiscal stress issue more traffic tickets, suggesting that revenue considerations influence enforcement. More directly relevant, a recent working paper by {cite}`kaila2024` exploits Finland's income-based fine system to estimate behavioral responses, finding that a €200 increase in fine amount reduces reoffending by 15% over six months.

## Distributional Concerns and Fairness

The fairness argument for income-based fines has deep roots in legal philosophy. The "day-fine" system, originating in Scandinavia, explicitly aims to impose equal sacrifice across income levels. Legal scholars like Lerman and Weaver (2014) document how flat fines can trap low-income individuals in cycles of debt and license suspension, effectively criminalizing poverty.

However, the economics literature offers a more nuanced view of fairness in penalty design. Kaplow and Shavell (2002) argue that distributional concerns are generally better addressed through the tax-and-transfer system rather than through the design of specific policies. Garoupa (1997) shows that wealth-dependent criminal sanctions can be optimal when wealth and criminal productivity are correlated, but may create perverse incentives when they are not.

## Labor Supply Responses to Marginal Tax Rates

The labor supply literature provides crucial parameters for our analysis. {cite}`chetty2012` synthesizes evidence on labor supply elasticities, distinguishing between intensive margin responses (hours worked) and extensive margin responses (participation). For prime-age workers, intensive margin elasticities typically range from 0.1 to 0.3, while participation elasticities can be substantially higher, especially for secondary earners.

Keane (2011) emphasizes the importance of human capital accumulation in understanding labor supply responses, noting that career concerns can amplify the long-run effects of tax changes. This dynamic consideration suggests that our static model may underestimate the costs of income-based fines for young professionals whose current work effort affects future earning potential.

## Behavioral Economics and Salience

Recent work in behavioral public finance highlights the importance of salience in determining responses to taxes and penalties. Chetty, Looney, and Kroft (2009) show that less salient taxes generate smaller behavioral responses. This finding has ambiguous implications for our context: income-based fines may be more salient than regular taxes (because they arrive as discrete penalties) but less salient than flat fines (because the amount varies with income).

Taubinsky and Rees-Jones (2018) demonstrate that behavioral biases can affect optimal tax design, potentially justifying departures from standard Ramsey taxation principles. If individuals systematically underestimate the accident risks from speeding—as suggested by the prevalence of speeding behavior—then higher fines might be justified on behavioral grounds independent of their income-linkage.

## International Experience with Income-Based Fines

Several countries have experimented with income-based fine systems, providing valuable evidence on their practical effects. Finland's day-fine system, operational since 1921, calculates fines based on the offender's daily disposable income. Switzerland and several German states use similar systems. These experiences reveal both successes and challenges:

The Finnish system has generated some notable cases, including a €116,000 speeding fine issued to a business executive in 2023, which generated significant media attention and public debate about fairness. Administrative data from Finland suggests high compliance rates and public support for the system, though comprehensive welfare analyses remain scarce.

## Synthesis and Gaps

While the existing literature provides valuable insights into the components of our analysis—optimal taxation, traffic deterrence, and distributional concerns—no previous work has formally modeled the interaction between income-based fines and labor supply decisions. Our paper fills this gap by developing a unified framework that captures both the intended deterrence effects and unintended labor market distortions of income-based penalties.

Moreover, we extend the literature by considering general equilibrium effects through revenue recycling and endogenous accident risks. These features prove quantitatively important for welfare comparisons and have been largely overlooked in previous discussions of fine design.
