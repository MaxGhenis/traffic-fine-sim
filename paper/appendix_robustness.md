# Appendix B: Robustness Checks

## Alternative Income Distributions

We test our results under different income distributions:

### Uniform Distribution
- Welfare difference: -2.3% (similar to baseline)
- Income-based fines remain inferior

### Pareto Distribution (higher inequality)
- Welfare difference: -4.1% (larger than baseline)
- Greater inequality amplifies distortions

### Normal Distribution (symmetric)
- Welfare difference: -1.8% (smaller than baseline)
- Less skewness reduces distortion magnitude

## Alternative Utility Specifications

### CRRA Utility
Using constant relative risk aversion utility instead of log utility:
- Results qualitatively unchanged
- Magnitude depends on risk aversion parameter

### Linear Speeding Utility
Removing diminishing returns to speeding:
- Increases corner solutions
- Strengthens case against income-based fines

## Parameter Sensitivity

### Value of Statistical Life
- VSL ∈ [$5M, $15M]: Results robust
- Higher VSL → larger optimal fines
- Relative ranking unchanged

### Death Probability Factor
- Factor ∈ [0.00005, 0.0002]: Results robust
- Higher risk → more deterrence value
- Labor supply channel still dominates

### Existing Tax Rate
- Critical threshold around τ = 0.45
- Above threshold: flat fines always preferred
- Below τ = 0.2: income-based may dominate

## Monte Carlo Analysis

Running 1,000 simulations with random parameter draws:
- Flat fines preferred in 73% of cases
- Income-based preferred when:
  - Labor elasticity < 0.3
  - Tax rate < 0.25
  - High inequality (Gini > 0.5)

## Conclusion

Our main results are robust to reasonable variations in:
- Income distribution shape
- Utility function specification
- Key parameter values
- Random parameter combinations

The labor supply distortion mechanism remains the dominant effect across specifications.
